Method

Peel cucumber, cut in half lengthways and de-seed using a teaspoon, then coarsely grate.

Put grated cucumber into a sieve suspended over a bowl, sprinkle over 1/2 tsp of salt and mix through. Place a plate on top of cucumber and allow cucumber to drain for approximately 1 hour, or until water stops dripping (whichever is first).

Combine all the ingredients and mix thoroughly.

The flavours combine better if given time so I prefer to leave it in a sealed container in the refrigerator overnight.

If Greek yoghurt is not available then you can make your own Greek style from plain yoghurt by suspending a sieve lined with cheesecloth over a bowl, adding the yoghurt and allowing it to drain for 2-3 hours, or longer if thicker yoghurt is preferred, in a refrigerator. A paper coffee filter can be used as an alternative to a cheesecloth, following the above method.
